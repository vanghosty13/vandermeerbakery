<div class="title">Le Mars Bakery Closing</div>
<div class="para">By Melissa Lanzourakis, KTIV</div>
<div class="para">12/28/2005</div>
<div class="para">The doors of the Vander Meer Bakery have been open since 1934. Pete Vander Meer Senior opened the store with visions of a "mom and pop" bakery. His taste for pasteries, donuts, cakes, and breads held true for decades. On Saturday the bakery will close.</div>
<div class="para">Years after the Senior Vander Meer opened the bakery, his son Pete Vander Meer Junior took over. After he retired, the bakery was sold but the new owners kept the Vander Meer name.</div>
<div class="para">Folks all over town come here to pick up birthday and wedding cakes, ginerbread houses, donuts, peanut brittle ... all made right here from scratch for 71 years.</div>
<div class="para">Clint Faust of Le Mars IA said, "It's good food, we always get our donuts here. It's just kind of a family business and we like going here."</div>
<div class="para">Even though the doors will close, people are not only taking pasteries and bread with them but also their childhood memories.</div>
<div class="para">Pat Denney says, "We use to come after school and go through the dumpster and look for small cardboard boxes and we'd bring them down here and trade them for snacks after school."</div>
<div class="para">Memories that will last for years to come.</div>
<div class="para">The Vander Meer bakery will close Saturday afternoon at three.</div>
<div class="para">The store hasn't been bought yet, but many are hoping the new owners will keep the store a bakery with the Vander Meer name.</div>

<div class="commenttext">I have wonderful memories of First Friday's at Gehlen.  When we were kids we looked forward to having fried rolls and glazed donuts in the high school cafeteria after Mass.
I'm going to miss the Tom and Jerry Mix during the holidays.  Any chance of getting the recipe?</div>

<div class="commenttext">Viewing the blog on VanderMeer Bakery brought back many wonderful maemories except for the times I helped Pete Jr. clean baking pans. Carmel is wonderful on rolls but not on a  pan. However, it was a way to earn a few bucks in H.S.</div>

<div class="commenttext">I know my mother Anita Kilpatrick will really miss your buttermilk sugar donuts. The best anywhere she always said. I also remember the fried rolls and glazed donuts and milk on First Fridays at Gehlen with Janice Kellen Mahoney and the class of 1969!
I enjoyed seeing the pictures of the past. Hi Dorothy!</div>

<div class="commenttext">The "Crispies" were definitely a family favorite with us, especially with almond filling! From my college years at Westmar, to placing orders from Arizona 30 years later. Do you have an idea of where to get any half as good, or will you post recipes?</div>

<div class="commenttext">All of The recipies were sold with the bakery. Many of the old products have been brought back,indcluding the dutch tradition of almond patties. And another point, you don't have to be dutch to make a great product.</div>
